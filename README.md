# CheckIt - Task Manager App

CheckIt is a single-page web application designed for anyone who wants to keep organized.You shouldn't have to read a manual to use an app that helps you stay organized and with CheckIt you don't have to! 

CheckIt allows users to keep track of their everyday tasks. Users can add, update and delete tasks as they complete them, and each task is categorized into 1 of 4 priorities per the Eisnehower Matrix (Important and Urgent, Important and Not Urgent, Urgent and Not Important, Not Urgent and Not Important).

## Planning Story

I began planning on creating some type of to-do list app as I am always struggling to stay organized. I drew up my wiredrame and ERD and was able to formulte a plan to create it. My app remained unnamed until days later!

The first step was to set up the back end API and make sure to enable CRUD actions on authentication and resources. Next, was setting up the front end, following a similar CRUD process. Finally, I designed the front end using the React framework.
